    <h3>The history of criminal culture</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The history of crime reflects a long-standing culture of resistance against authority, particularly stemming from the British Empire. Sailors and traders played a crucial role in spreading this culture, crossing borders and establishing a worldview based on freedom and independence from state control, but in the hands of those in power outside traditional power - relying on specific morals that are outside the normal morals of society. These groups often created their own social codes that prioritized loyalty and honor over societal laws, positioning themselves as liberators rather than mere criminals. They have communicated with each other throughout centuries, but regular people tend to view them as individual cases. In other words - a gang member today, is just as much a member of the mafia in the '20s, who was just as much a gang member in the Wild West. They rely on generational wealth and knowledge, just as society. People tend to look outside this fact in their fictional views of characters and stories.</li>
        <li>In the United States, a culture emerged fueled by a history of rebellion against authority and British rule. The opportunists relied on each other - if they were memebers of "lawful" society or not. This environment allowed organized crime, particularly the mafia, to flourish, drawing directly from the values directly established by pirates and smugglers.</li>
        <li>As the criminals in the US expanded from the Wild West, it adopted methods such as bribery and extortion, allowing it to provide for marginalized communities and operate independently of the state like in the case of the Mafia. This adaptation maintained a lineage to pirate traditions, demonstrating that crime can be a means of empowerment and economic opportunity, a value which the US is founded upon and cherished.</li>
        <li>Criminal networks have also intertwined with politics, against the civil rights movement and worker's unions i.e. - and the Ku Klux Klan was a political party, that also hired criminals to do their dirty work. Industrialists have used criminals for centuries.</li>
        <li>From its roots in piracy to modern organized crime, this culture continues to thrive, illustrating a complex relationship between crime, power, and societal resistance - manipulating and taking advantage of the public's knowledge of what is really happening. From pop culture to politics...</li>
        <in>In the case of a crime, it is then important to examine the potential influence from culture as well, like from organized crime, rather than just from the potential psychological standpoint of the individual - as for exactly understanding the criminal mind</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The mythology and mindset of criminal culture</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Recruitment of the Young: Criminal organizations have long utilized targeted recruitment strategies to attract younger individuals, often exploiting their vulnerabilities. Criminals present themselves as modern-day Robin Hoods or rebels against oppression, appealing to youth disillusioned with societal norms and authority which they might experience as unfair. Pirates, for instance, crafted myths around freedom and adventure at sea, attracting those seeking excitement and purpose. They stalk youth to see who can be recruited. They plant ideas in the minds of youth and present them with a reality which they have created themselves, and in the unpreparedness of it that harsh truth - the youth listen to them.</li>
        <li>Community and Belonging: Gangs and organized crime groups provide a sense of belonging and family, often filling emotional voids for those who feel marginalized. This can be particularly effective in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, where young people may seek identity and loyalty. Older members often act as mentors, providing guidance and initiating youths into the culture. This can include rites of passage such as tattoos, which symbolize allegiance and personal transformation within the criminal identity - an identity that is dubiously intertwined with a notion of some sort of virtue.</li>
        <li>Combatting Authorities: Throughout history, criminal groups have developed strategies to resist law enforcement and maintain their influence. Criminals often infiltrate law enforcement and political structures, using bribery and corruption to undermine efforts against them. The mafia, for instance, has a long history of colluding with public officials to secure their operations and avoid prosecution. Engaging in guerrilla warfare, such as sabotage or hit-and-run tactics, allows groups to strike against authorities while minimizing direct confrontation. Historical bandits in the Wild West often used the landscape to their advantage, evading capture through knowledge of the terrain. These are tactics that have been expanded upon - today, we rely on a terrain that is cultural, personal and social to navigate through life...</li>
        <li>Propaganda and Fear-Mongering: Criminals cultivate a reputation that instills fear among both the public and law enforcement. The Ku Klux Klan, for example, employed acts of terror to maintain control over communities, effectively dissuading opposition through intimidation. The same did the mob, and the same does gang members today. It is ignorant to think that this pertains to just one kind of personality - hoodlums, or one type of community. In fact, criminal elements have been present in a multitude of institutions, including military and law enforcement.</li>
        <li>Playing on Public Fear: Criminal organizations often create and exploit fear to consolidate power and control over communities. The mafia exemplifies this tactic by presenting themselves as protectors while simultaneously creating threats. They may intimidate business owners, and then offer “protection” services, thus creating a dependency that reinforces their power. By engaging in public displays of violence, such as executions or severe punishments for betrayal, criminal groups reinforce their authority and dissuade dissent. For example, tattoos symbolizing loyalty to a gang can serve as a visual reminder of the consequences of betrayal, with members often viewing murder as a badge of honor rather than a crime. Criminal cultures often promote myths around honor, with murder and retaliation viewed as acts of bravery. This is evident in the way gangs celebrate loyalty through violent retribution against snitches or traitors, creating a code where snitching is met with severe punishment, fostering an environment of silence and complicity.</li>
        <li>Tattoos play a significant role in criminal cultures, serving as symbols of allegiance and identity. In many gangs, tattoos can represent rank, achievements, or membership, acting as both a personal badge of honor and a public declaration of belonging. This visual element reinforces the group’s mythology and solidifies the cultural narrative of loyalty and strength. It becomes a secret that is apparent to those who know - and you get to know who to admire and who to respect.</li>
        <li>In organized crime, ciphers have been used to communicate plans, orders, or threats without attracting the attention of law enforcement. For example, the Mafia has historically used codes to discuss illegal activities and manage operations. During the age of piracy, pirates and smugglers utilized ciphers to communicate strategies or coordinate activities across ships and crews. This secrecy was vital in avoiding capture by naval authorities. It is foolish to see a use of a cipher as such, that the individual had to be interested in ciphers from an educational standpoint, if education wasn't part of their plan in the first place.</in>
        <li>Overall, the psychological tactics employed by criminal organizations, grounded in their historical narratives, provide insight into how these groups attract and maintain their influence. By creating a culture where violence, loyalty, and fear are intertwined, they sustain a complex and resilient societal structure that often opposes and undermines established norms and authorities. They rely on fear and chaos to take advantage, and a common reoccurence is the perversion of morals, in which it is lawful to take another mans life. You can see this mentality clearly in the Jesuit effort to stop the protestant movement, that they deemed it lawful to do unlawful things, as long as it supported the main cause. Criminals operate under the same rule, but you don't know the intetion of your supervisor. Society operates on transparancy. If there is a hidden element to something, you can be sure that it is of criminal origin. Criminals benefit from socializing with other criminals. It is just in the rare occurence of a social outlier, that they don't.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Some dispositions about working on this case<h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Some assumptions are necessary. But it is important to consider your assumptions as assumptions, and declear them as such. Working from the angle of one concrete suspect is not a good approach, if you consider that there are more unconfirmed cases, which there is evidence for that it might be. Regardless, working structurally and with a combined effort is a better approach. It is also a better approach to collect as much evidence as possible, and then sort it - to try to get a better picture.</li>
            <li>My general assumption is that the Zodiac Killer killed Cheri Jo Bates, because of the likeness. I will have something more concrete to argue for that case later, but in any case - the writer of the letters around that murder, confessed to killing others. Then it is likely that there are other murders. If there is other murders, then there is possibly more circumstantial evidence against him. The goal of this project is to work from that angle, and collect and sort as much information as possible.</li>
            <li>It was a different time. Lover's lane slayings were common at that time. People were balsting up stuff, killing cabdrivers, etc. That's why I don't buy the idea that everyone is the killer, just because they had explosives, i.e. Just examine some news papers, and you'll see it was a really crazy time back then. This means that there are many more "Zodiacs" out there, and that our impression of him as an unique person is soley based on the publicity of this case. It is important therefor to make up an honest impression about him, and not how we feel about him.</li>
            <li>In the light that the Zodiac might be actually a career criminal - and not some genius mastermind, or a weird social outcast - we need to consider that he didn't start his criminal career by killing people. Then there might be more definitive evidence against him that is based on his criminal history. At that time lover's lane killings were common, and some of them were done by criminals. It doesn't mean it doesn't have a psychological component to it, but it doesn't exclude the possibility of being a criminal either. Likely, he developed his skills. A common past time of criminals at that time was to do holdups. And as you can see in the Bates case, he did tinker with her car, thus expressing criminal knowledge.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the killer might have been charged with a crime and was let go. Or, other people might have been wrongfully convicted of murders relating to him, which is a common occurence. In that case, that specific case wouldn't have caught anyone's attention, and we would be at a general loss. In one clue that I have made up, I present a case such as that, where someone might have been wrongfully convicted based on assumptions and the circumstantial evidence.</li>
            <li>At last, is to consider the possibility that he worked with others, like say other criminals, brothers or childhood friends. In my research I've seen evidence of people commiting similar crimes, but in groups.</li>
